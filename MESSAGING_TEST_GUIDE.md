# Messaging System Testing Guide

## Problem Summary

Your messaging system is working correctly, but all messages appear as "YOU" because you're testing with the same user account. To properly test message attribution, you need messages from different users.

## Current Status

‚úÖ Backend authentication is working (tokens are properly separated by role)
‚úÖ Message creation and retrieval is working
‚úÖ Role-based routes are implemented correctly
‚úÖ Frontend user identification logic is implemented correctly

## Testing the Message Attribution System

### Step 1: Create Different User Accounts

You need at least 2 different users to test properly:

1. **Customer Account**: Regular user account
2. **Staff/Admin Account**: Staff or admin user account

### Step 2: Test Scenario

1. Log in as **Customer** ‚Üí Send a message in a conversation
2. Log out, then log in as **Staff/Admin** ‚Üí Send a reply in the same conversation
3. Log out, then log in as **Customer** again ‚Üí View the conversation

**Expected Result**:

- Customer's messages should show "You"
- Staff/Admin messages should show "Staff: [Name]" or "Admin: [Name]"

### Step 3: Check Database (If needed)

Run this script to see your current users and messages:

```bash
cd backend
node test-messaging.js
```

## How to Create Test Users

### Option 1: Register through UI

1. Go to registration page
2. Create a staff/admin account (you may need to manually change role in database)

### Option 2: Create directly in database

You can use MongoDB Compass or run this script:

```javascript
// Create test admin user
const newAdmin = new User({
  first_name: "Admin",
  last_name: "Test",
  email: "admin@test.com",
  password: "hashedpassword", // Use proper password hashing
  roles: "admin",
  isVerified: true,
});
await newAdmin.save();
```

## Expected Logs (When Working Correctly)

### Backend logs should show different senderIds:

```javascript
üì§ SENDING MESSAGES: [
  {
    content: "Customer message...",
    senderId: new ObjectId('689a562e8190b7c82459fe9c'), // Customer ID
    senderRole: 'customer'
  },
  {
    content: "Staff reply...",
    senderId: new ObjectId('689a562e8190b7c82459fe9d'), // Staff ID (different)
    senderRole: 'staff'
  }
]
```

### Frontend logs should show proper attribution:

```javascript
üîç Message Attribution: {
  currentUserId: '689a562e8190b7c82459fe9c', // Current user
  senderId: '689a562e8190b7c82459fe9d',      // Message sender (different = not isOwn)
  isOwn: false,                             // Correctly identifies as not own message
  senderRole: 'staff'
}
```

## Quick Fix for Testing

If you don't want to create multiple accounts right now, you can temporarily modify the frontend to simulate different users by changing the user ID comparison logic for testing purposes.

## Next Steps

1. Create a second user account with different role
2. Send messages from both accounts in the same conversation
3. View conversation from both perspectives
4. Verify that message attribution works correctly

The system is built correctly - it just needs proper multi-user testing!
